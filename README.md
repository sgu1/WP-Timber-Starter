# WP-Timber-Starter
<h2>My repository to get quickly started with the timber plugin</h2>
<p>
This repo uses gulp and npm. Everything is already set up to compile your js and sass. Please take a look over the gulpfile to see what it does.
gitignore is set up to ignore everything except the theme. There are also white lists that you can add.
